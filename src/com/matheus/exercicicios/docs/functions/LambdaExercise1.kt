Exercise 1
You have a list of actions supported by a web service, a common prefix for all requests, and an ID of a particular resource.
To request an action title over the resource with ID: 5, you need to create the following URL: https://example.com/book-info/5/title.
Use a lambda expression to create a list of URLs from the list of actions.

fun main() {
    val actions = listOf("title", "year", "author")
    val prefix = "https://example.com/book-info"
    val id = 5
    val urls = actions.map { action -> "$prefix/$id/$action" }
    println(urls)
